- Discussing methods for implemeting template
We discussed different methods on how to implement the frontend.We had two main methods:
a. using a library called surveyjs
b.using routes and component to house the questions
- Testing the first method
We decided to use the surveyjs method.We build the frontend with the questions and answers.The web app became very responsive and we styled the app to have a better UX/UI.
- Creating the react template for the app
After we created the questions and answers ,we integrated the jwt login token to the app.Everything workout out fine.
There was a issue with this method and that was that the questions were hard coded which violates the project requierement to get the questions and answers from the backend.

# day-three
- testing the second method for the frontend
We decided to test the second method and that was building the component for the questions and then calling them.
We stumbled upon some problems with these methods.
1.The app didn't allow us to configure the routing.After a lot of trail and error we decided to abandon the idea of routing.
2.We then discussed on how to implement the GET and POST methods.We stumbled in a lot of errors.
