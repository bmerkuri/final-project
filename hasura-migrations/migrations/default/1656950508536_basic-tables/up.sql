--- QUESTIONS
--- This is a "append only" table, new versions of the same record are
--- appended at the very bottom of the table with a new "created_at" timestamp.
---
--- Fillfactor is 100 because there is never fragmentation due to UPDATE or DELETE statements:
--- https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/postgres-fillfactor-baf3117aca0a
---
---
--- Drawback:
--- If we perfome a huge amount of editing on the questions, this solution
--- might not be performing very well at scale.
--- Need some heavy testing.
